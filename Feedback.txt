Rubric for Project 2: Game of Set

Grader: Simon Stuard

Team Name: Temporary Variables

Grade: 18.5/20

Comments: You really went above and beyond with the network based game, this was great. 
The GUI could be a bit more helpful to the user when playing. 
I also found that the hint function didn't return a hint when two players were connected to the host. 
Also, in your README, describe the organization of your code/classes. 
Other than this, you guys are on the right track! Great project.

### Documentation ###

4. Excellent
* Readme is thorough
* In-code documentation is complete (e.g. mathematical models for abstractions)
* Writing is compelling and crisp

### Correctness ###

3.5. Great
* Fully correct and very robust, even to almost all malicious user actions. If you type in a letter that is not on the board for the cards, it is still accepted.

### Functionality/Features ###

3.5. Great
* Particularly engaging game with several extra features. I ony take off 0.5 here because the GUI could be a bit more helpful to the user in the card designs, but overall still a somewhat easy game to play. Also, with multiple players on localhost, the hint command didn't return any hints after the request.
* People will want to play this game in their spare time

### Style ###

3.5. Great
* Strict adherence to a known style
* No documented style rules - describe your style rules in the README, how did you organize the code?
* Excellent use of standard libraries and idiomatic Ruby

### Design ###

4. Excellent
* Beautiful classes with clean APIs
* Clear separation of abstraction and concrete representation
* Trivially generalizable along multiple dimensions
